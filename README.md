# CodVeda Internship Tasks

Welcome!  
This repository contains all the tasks completed during my **CodVeda Internship**. The work is organized into three levels â€” each containing hands-on projects that explore frontend, backend, authentication, and full-stack development.


##  Levels Overview

###  [Level 1](./Level1/)
- **Focus:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics.
- **Highlights:** Static webpages, responsive designs, and basic user interactions.

###  [Level 2](./Level2/)
- **Focus:** Dynamic UI using React.js.
- **Highlights:** Component-based design, props, state management, simple form handling.

###  [Level 3](./Level3/)
- **Focus:** Full-stack development (Frontend + Backend).
- **Highlights:**
  - User authentication (JWT)
  - Node.js & Express.js API
  - MongoDB integration
  - Profile-based routing
  - Token verification


##  How to Run Projects

Each task has its own `README.md` with steps to run the respective projects. For full-stack projects:

1. Navigate to the backend directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start

2. Navigate to the frontend (React) directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start

 Ensure MongoDB and environment variables (like MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET) are properly configured in .env.

Feel free to explore each level to see my learning journey and implementations!
